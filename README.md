# NullStream (macOS)

A minimal distraction free macOS YouTube player built with SwiftUI and WKWebView, using the YouTube iframe API.
I use this to listen to music when I need to focus and can't afford getting distracted. 

## Features

- **Playback control**: Play, pause and seek (told you it was minimal)
- **Video list**: Manage a library of videos to play
- **Persistence**: Video URLs stored locally in UserDefaults

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0+
- Xcode 15+

## Building

1. Open `NullStream.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Select the NullStream scheme
3. Build and run (⌘R)

## Usage

1. **Add a video**: Click "Add URL" and paste a YouTube URL (e.g. `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`)
2. **Play/Pause**: Use the control bar or ⌘Space
3. **Left pane**: Toggle the sidebar to show/hide your saved video list
4. **Open new video**: Use the + button in the player controls or add from the list
